Waurum is a community built back in 2020 and based around Garry's mod servers. We plans to move on other games & create a game studio in a far future thanks to both our amazing players & team members !

Even if we try to pick the best of existing addons to build our servers, we also don't hesitate at editing them to fit perfectly our way of thinking and your way of playing.

Our main focus is on our player's feedbacks & suggestions. Indeed, we believe in them and we think that it's what will makes use progress in the future !

Our servers & platforms are always being improved, either it's day or night. Make sure to follow our changelogs & Discord news.

We won't promise you the best experience you'll ever have, but keep in mind that each day is a possibility to learn & improve ourselves and we're taking that.
